## Welcome to Clean Arch Mvc

## Overview
CleanArchMvc is a sample project demonstrating the implementation of Clean Architecture principles in a .NET 7 application. The project is organized into several layers to ensure separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into the following main layers:

- **CleanArchMvc.Application**: Contains the application logic, including commands, queries, and handlers. This layer is responsible for implementing the use cases of the system.
- **CleanArchMvc.Domain**: Defines the core business logic and domain entities. It includes domain services, aggregates, and value objects.
- **CleanArchMvc.Domain.Tests**: Contains unit tests for the domain layer to ensure the correctness of business logic and domain entities.
- **CleanArchMvc.Infra.Data**: Implements the data access logic, including repositories and database context. This layer interacts with the database.
- **CleanArchMvc.Infra.IoC**: Handles dependency injection and service registration. It helps in configuring services and dependencies across different layers.
- **CleanArchMvc.WebUI**: Represents the presentation layer, including controllers, views, and API endpoints. This layer handles the user interface and user interactions.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **CleanArchMvc.sln**: The solution file that organizes the projects within the solution.
- **README.md**: This document provides an overview and instructions for the project.
